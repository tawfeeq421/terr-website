# AWS Infrastructure with Terraform

This repository contains Terraform code to create a simple AWS infrastructure with VPC, subnets, security groups, S3 bucket, EC2 instances, and an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The infrastructure includes two web servers and an ALB distributing traffic between them.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed on your machine.
- AWS credentials configured on your machine.

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
Initialize Terraform:

terraform init
Review and Apply the Terraform Plan:

terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy

Make sure to replace placeholders like `your-username` and `your-repo` with your actual GitHub username and repository name. Also, adjust the Terraform code description and notes based on the specifics of your infrastructure.
